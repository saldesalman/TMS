This is 95% of whats on offer in our project i'ev to do a little change yet in this code ..
which includes using template and friend function . But layout and most part will remain be same.
Run this program on your system .. And save it where Morning.txt and Night.txt are saved ... Though this code is yet limted as i ev
made for 10 seats in 2 trains each we cant yet change it .. which is not a big issue.
Everyother concept i ev tried to use.. Incase of any lacking point you observe in this code tell me by tomrow. 
And try to understand code (Your marks matter on ur presentation)   indentation is done..
.. 

You first have sign up ... and then u can sign in .. save the program where morning.txt and night.txt are saved ... 
..and basically morning.txt and night.txt contain seat of train(1 represnt empty 0 reprsent reserved) and last in both files is counted
number of seats after every action ... incase of even no flaw or idea... Do messenger ur feedback ..... but but by tomrow evening .



Incase of Any flaw any mistake or any idea which u think is lacking inform me...
